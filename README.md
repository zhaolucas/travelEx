## Introduction

This is the first project for the front-end web development bootcamp. 

Our group has used everything we have learned to create a real-world front-end application that we will be able to showcase to potential employers. Our project uses Bootstrap, is deployed to GitHub Pages, is interactive and has a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application). 

The application uses client-side storage to store persistent data and does not use JS alerts, prompts, or confirms, but uses modals and cards. This project deploys 2 APIs (https://rapidapi.com/DataCrawler/api/tripadvisor16 and https://rapidapi.com/fyhao/api/currency-exchange/), to get data about hotels and currency for the country. 

This app allows holiday planners to check for the best prices for hotels and allows them to convert their local currency to another currency of choice easily. It will help the user to plan a holiday or work trip to a destination of their choice. 

User Story: 
As a thrifty aspiring Front-End development student,
I want to find budget hotels and airlines,
And calculate the potential expenses in local currencies,
So that I can plan a cost-effective vacation after graduation to reward myself 
without overspending.
